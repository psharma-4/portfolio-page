 The page is styled using various features of CSS such as background, position(specially to create fixed buttons),float and oreintation features .
 
 Lastely,HTML, CSS and Java script is used to give a preloader to the page using the onload function of Java Script....
 
 ###Unique

 Second was to make the layout of the page mobile-friendly..
 The first problem was sorted .
 However, the second one was not completely solved due to lack of time.
 
 ###Scope of Improvement

 Moreover,I would like to add more features to my webpage using CSS and Java script and make it more mobile friendly.
